## About This Project

This is my first laravel project showcasing a simple app that lets the user view, store, edit, and delete notes. Most importantly the app features the use of an account system that registers users with an email and password as well as authentication. Restrictions are implemented so that when a user creates an account they cannot view other users' notes.
